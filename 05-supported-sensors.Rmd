# Supported sensors

## BME680

4-in-1 sensor that provides humidity, temperature, pressure, and gas readings.

## DS18B20

The DS18B20 is a digital thermometer that provides Celsius measurements over a 1-Wire interface. It is a low-cost, low-power device that can be used for a variety of environmental monitoring applications. Waterproof versions are available, making it suitable for use in water and soils.

## DHT11

The DHT11 is a low-cost  temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and sends the data by digital signals on the data pin.

The low-cost nature of the sensor makes it useful desp ite several shortcomings, e.g. for monitoring the temperature and humidity inside electronics enclosures where accuracy is not critical but the sensor can provide critical early warning of overheating or condensation.
