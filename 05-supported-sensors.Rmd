## DHT11

The DHT11 is a low-cost  temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and sends the data by digital signals on the data pin.

The low-cost nature of the sensor makes it useful desp ite several shortcomings, e.g. for monitoring the temperature and humidity inside electronics enclosures where accuracy is not critical but the sensor can provide critical early warning of overheating or condensation.

## BME680

4-in-1 sensor that provides humidity, temperature, pressure, and gas readings.
