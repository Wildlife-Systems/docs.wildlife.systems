Support WildlifeSystems nodes were originally developed and used as part of the Leverhulme Trust funded Automated Acoustic Observatories project at the University of York. Additional development is undertaken as part of the Urban Nature Project at the Natural History Museum, London.

The modular nature of WildlifeSystems allows for new sensors to be easily integrated if the need arises. Each sensor may have a number of sensor devices that can be read, for instance many senors modules on the market currently can measure both air temperature and air humidity. 4.1 Sensors included in the base system The Raspberry Pi does not come with environmental sensors, however there are several onboard sensors that are used to monitor the operation of the hardware, to prevent crucial components from overheating, including the temperature of the CPU and GPU chips. WildlifeSystems provides access to these sensors through the sensor-onboard package, as well as providing some software sensors that report the free memory and free SD storage available. These can be useful for detecting and resolving possible issues on a sensor node before a serious problem arises. 4.2 Installing sensor support Support for sensors is installed as part of the node installation process, however it is possible to install the sensor-control abstraction layer onto any Raspberry Pi system using the command below. wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wildlife-Systems/sensor-control/main/install | sudo bash This will install the sensor-control and sensor-onboard scripts into the system, as well as installing a small of number of supporting packages if they are not already installed. 4.3 Reading data from a sensor The sensor read command, sr, can be used to list the available devices on a given sensor. sr onboard list The sensor read command, sr, can also be used to read data from a named sensor. Not specifying a sensor device is equivalent to reading all devices on that senors (i.e. using the wildcard”*“). sr onboard sr onboard * sr onboard onboard_gpu This will give a JSON string listing information about each sensor (or just the specified sensor), and the current reading. This information can be presented in a more human readable form by piping the output to the program jq, a command line JSON processor. sr onboard | jq 4.4 The sensor reading process The sensor reading process in WildlifeSystems has five steps. The sr command identifies which sensor script to route the request to. The sensor script calls the sc-prototype script to obtain a template (“prototype”) of the JSON request. The sensor script accesses the relevant sensor(s) and populates the values in a template for each sensor reading, before returning a JSON array of populated readings to sr. The sr script populates additional information for each reading, providing the node_id and a timestamp for each. sr returns the finalised JSON array to the user. 4.5 Installing new sensors "],["implementing-new-sensors.html", "Chapter 5 Implementing new sensors 5.1 Reading the sensor 5.2 Setting the environment 5.3 Install 5.4 The installation process with si 5.5 Submitting packages to WildlifeSystems", " Chapter 5 Implementing new sensors New sensors should be implemented as new packages (i.e, a new GitHub repository). Packages have a standard format, and should be named sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; where &lt;sensor-name&gt; is short, descriptive of the sensor (e.g. model number), and unique within the WildlifeSystems ecosystem. The structure of a basic package is given below. . +-- inst | +-- files that are not part of the package structure | used during installation (e.g. 3rd party scripts | to be copied to /usr/bin/) | +-- sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; | Executable to read sensor and print JSON of readings | (copied on install to /usr/bin/) | +-- &lt;sensor-name&gt; | Configuration file | (copied on install to /var/aao/sensors/) | +-- install | Bash file run once on install - used to install packaged | dependencies, etc. As many people implement various sensors on the Raspberry Pi, it is likely that some sort of solution is already available, that can be tweaked to output readings in the standard format required. However, you must ensure that any licensing conditions are met. In particular, an open license is required if submitting your sensor package to WildlifeSystems for inclusion in the ecosystem. 5.1 Reading the sensor File sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; provides the functionality to read the protoype JSON, populate the JSON with sensor readings, and print the output. The file can be written in any programming or scripting language, but to prevent overhead consideration should be given to minimising the number of new packages installed. 5.1.1 In bash #!/bin/bash # Read the prototype JSON JSON=$(sc-prototype) echo -n &quot;[&quot; # Code to read the sensor value into GPU_TEMP # Use `jq` to modify JSON SENSOR=$(echo $JSON | jq &quot;.sensor |= \\&quot;onboard_gpu\\&quot; | .measures |= \\&quot;temperature\\&quot; | .unit |= \\&quot;Celsius\\&quot;| .value |= ${GPU_TEMP}&quot;) echo -n $SENSOR echo &quot;]&quot; 5.1.2 In Python #!/ import os import json # Read the prototype JSON stream = os.popen(&#39;sc-prototype&#39;) output = stream.read() # Pre-populate with sensor metadata temperature = json.loads(output) temperature[&quot;sensor&quot;] = &quot;bme680_temperature&quot; temperature[&quot;measures&quot;] = &quot;temperature&quot; temperature[&quot;unit&quot;] = &quot;Celsius&quot; # Code to read sensor and output in variable `sensor_reading` temperature[&quot;value&quot;] = sensor_reading # Output the JSON in an array print(&quot;[&quot;,json.dumps(temperature),&quot;]&quot;) 5.2 Setting the environment The file &lt;sensor-name&gt; in the package specifies information that modify the environment of the Raspberry Pi (e.g. if the i2c interface should be enabled) before the sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; script is run. This allows sensors with different requirements to run sequentially on the same node. The file must always be present, even if it is empty. During installation the file is moved to /var/aao/sensors/ and the list of files in this directory indicates to the system which sensors are installed. TODO: i2c 5.3 Install The file install in the directory is run once, when the sensor package is installed. This allows for the installation of packages and scripts necessary for the functioning of the package. The file is executed by bash and the use of sudo is allowed. 5.4 The installation process with si The sensor install script, si, from sensor-control is used to install sensor packages. For developer reference the installation process is described below. si clones the Wildlife-Systems/sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; repository from GitHub. The install script is executed. sensor-&lt;sensor-name is marked as executable and move to /usr/bin/. &lt;sensor-name&gt; is moved to /var/aao/sensors/. The cloned repository is removed from the local filesystem. 5.5 Submitting packages to WildlifeSystems Submitting packages (where licensing allows) to WildlifeSystems allows the ecosystem to be developed and sustained collaboratively by the user community. Packages can be sent to the administrators as a compressed file, or a request can be sent to fork an existing GitHub repository. Contact details can be found at https://wildlife.systems/contact.html.

In addition, there are small environmental benefits on consuming less power on systems which have continual grid power. The pi-pwr script can be used to turn off unused functionality, either always or just when it is not required. 10.1 Installation of power management tools The power management tools are installed as part of the node installation process, however they can be easily installed independently on any Raspberry Pi system. wget -O - https://github.com/wildlife-systems/pi-pwr/raw/master/install | sudo bash 10.2 Turning funtionality on and off 10.3 Considerations Disabling all network functionality will prevent the node from communicating until either the functionality is turned back on or the Raspberry Pi is restarted. If disabling all connectivity is desired periodically then the functionality to turn these systems back on must be scripted.
