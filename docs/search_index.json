The modular nature of WildlifeSystems allows for new sensors to be easily integrated if the need arises. 4.1 Sensors included in the base system The Raspberry Pi does not come with environmental sensors, however there are several onboard sensors that are used to monitor the operation of the hardware, to prevent crucial components from overheating, including the temperature of the CPU and GPU chips. WildlifeSystems provides access to these sensors through the sensor-onboard package, as well as providing some software sensors that report the free memory and free SD storage available. These can be useful for detecting and resolving possible issues on a sensor node before a serious problem arises. 4.2 Installing sensor support Support for sensors is installed as part of the node installation process, however it is possible to install the sensor-control abstraction layer onto any Raspberry Pi system using the command below. wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wildlife-Systems/sensor-control/main/install | sudo bash This will install the sensor-control and sensor-onboard scripts into the system, as well as installing a small of number of supporting packages if they are not already installed. 4.3 Reading data from a sensor The sensor read command, sr, can be used to read sensor data. sr onboard This will give a JSON string listing information about each sensor, and the current reading. This information can be presented in a more human readable form by piping the output to the program jq, a command line JSON processor. sr onboard | jq 4.4 The sensor reading process The sensor reading process in WildlifeSystems has five steps. The sr command identifies which sensor script to route the request to. The sensor script calls the sc-prototype script to obtain a template (“prototype”) of the JSON request. The sensor script access the relevant sensor(s) and populates the values in a template for each sensor reading, before returning a JSON array of populated readings to sr. The sr script populates additional information for each reading, providing the node_id and a timestamp for each. sr returns the finalised JSON array to the user. 4.5 Installing new sensors "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
