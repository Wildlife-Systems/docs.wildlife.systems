Support WildlifeSystems nodes were originally developed and used as part of the Leverhulme Trust funded Automated Acoustic Observatories project at the University of York. Additional development is undertaken as part of the Urban Nature Project at the Natural History Museum, London.

Biodiversity technologies are tools that allow researchers and others to study, monitor and conserve biodiversity. These tools can be used to monitor a wide range of species, habitats, and ecosystems, potentially in (near) real-time and/or from a great distance away. 1.1.1 What has enabled Biodiversity Technologies? The development of biodiversity technologies has been enabled by the rapid advances in sensor technology, data processing, and communication networks. These technologies have made it possible to collect, store, and analyse large amounts of data from a wide range of sources, including remote sensors, cameras, and acoustic recorders. This has been accompanied by a decline in the cost of these technologies (e.g. Figure 1.1), making them more accessible to researchers, conservationists, and others interested in monitoring biodiversity. ## Warning in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log): NAs introduced by coercion Figure 1.1: The decline in storage costs per megabyte in consumer hard drives. These technologies can potentially create vast datasets, and in order to adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), it is important for the data to be accompanied by an appropriate suite of data standards, such as those developed by TDWG. 1.2 Overall Philosophy 1.2.1 Leverage what already exists Many of the tools that are needed to monitor biodiversity already exist, and the goal of WildlifeSystems is to bring these tools together in a coherent and integrated way. This will allow researchers and others to build on existing technologies to develop new tools and applications that can be used to monitor biodiversity in a wide range of environments.These tools are designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use, and to provide a platform for the development of new technologies and applications. 1.2.2 Innovate where necessary “Technology is stuff that doesn’t work yet.” — Bran Ferren Where suitable technological solutions already exist, use them. Limit technological research to what needs to be new. Most of the time it’s OK to use existing technology, and focus development on the biodiversity related problem you’re trying to solve. Older technologies are often better understood and more stable. Some of the technologies WildlifeSystems leverages to innovate in the biodiversity sphere are given in Table 1.1. Table 1.1: Age of technologies underpinning WildlifeSystems. Technology Year Introduced Age in 2026 Ethernet 1973 53 BASH 1989 37 Linux 1991 35 1.2.3 Plan for heterogeneity Any network of devices will become heterogeneous given sufficient time. The primary driver of this shift to heterogeneity is continuous technological innovation combined with obsolescence of technical components. Secondary drivers are changes in the purpose, capabilities, and/or scale of the network over time. The WildlifeSystems ecosystem is designed to be able to handle this heterogeneity, and to allow for the easy integration of new technologies as they become available. 1.2.4 Modularise The WildlifeSystems ecosystem is designed to be modular, with each component able to be used independently or in combination with other components. This allows users to build custom solutions that meet their specific needs, and to easily add or remove components as required. Defined interfaces between components allow for easy integration of new technologies, and for components to be replaced or upgraded without affecting the rest of the system. This also lets contributors to focus on what they are best at. 1.2.5 Open Source 1.3 Structure of Wildlife Systems 1.3.1 Packages "],["nodes.html", "Chapter 2 Nodes 2.1 Standard node 2.2 Enclosures", " Chapter 2 Nodes The fundamental unit of the WildlifeSystems platform is the node. A node is a physical device that can be used to collect data from sensors, control devices, and communicate with other nodes. Nodes are (typically) Raspberry Pi computers, packaged with an array of environmental sensors, microphone(s), and/or camera(s). The WildlifeSystems software is used to configure a node to collect data from the sensors and what to do with the data collected. Typically this will be to send the data for external storage and analysis, but it is also possible to store the data locally on the node. Data can also be processed locally on the node, for example to detect a specific event (e.g. a sound or image) and then send a notification to the user. The WildlifeSystems software is designed to be modular, so that new sensors and devices can be added easily, and the data processing can be configured to suit the user’s needs. 2.1 Standard node There is no such thing as a ‘standard node’, apart from the core software interfaces. In some deployments, however, there will be a great deal of standardisation. The Urban Research Station deployment at the Natural History Museum, London, for example, has a number of nodes that are identically configured. Although even here, there are differences in the sensors used, and the data processing that is done. The nodes are all configured to send data to the same server (the Data Ecosystem) but the exact configuration of each node is driven by current research needs. In this way a network of WildlifeSystems nodes can be seen as a platform for facilitating research, rather than as a single-purpose device. To make it easier to deploy and work with individual nodes, it is recommended that some commonly used sensors are deployed in the standard fashion described below. 2.1.1 Self-monitoring Electricity and water should not mix. While suitable enclosures go a long way to preventing an unfortunate meeting, many nodes are deployed outside in the elements. The addition of a cheap DHT11 sensor internally to monitor the humidity and temperature of the enclosure may help identify a potentially damaging situation before it becomes problematic.

On startup, WildelifeSystems nodes run three systemd services that are responsible for processing audio, images, and environmental sensors. These sensors read the appropriate configuration files, and start collecting and recording data. 3.1 Audio The service ws-run-audio is configured by /etc/ws/audio.conf and is responsible for running the audio processing pipeline. The blocks in the pipeline are record, sleep, upload-delete, and clearup. 3.1.1 init 3.1.2 run 3.1.2.1 record 3.1.2.2 sleep 3.1.2.3 upload-delete 3.1.2.4 clearup In situations where network connection is temporarily unavailable it is possible that audio files will collect on the advice. These are not automatically processed during upload-delete and their processing must be handled manually, or by creating a processing scipt in clearup.

The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. 5.1.2 Humidity 5.1.2.1 Capacitive Humidity Sensors A capacitative humidity sensor consists of a small capacitor with a hygroscopic dielectric material between two electrodes. The dielectric material, usually a plastic or polymer, has a low dielectric constant when dry. In the presence of moisture, the dielectric constant increases due to water vapor, which has a much higher dielectric constant. As moisture is absorbed, the sensor’s capacitance increases. The amount of moisture absorbed depends on the surrounding temperature and water vapour pressure, which also affects the hygroscopic dielectric material used in the sensor. 5.1.3 Air Pressure 5.1.4 Gases 5.1.4.1 Heated Gas Resistance Heated gas sensors are used to detect gases in the air. The sensor consists of a metal oxide semiconductor that is heated to a high temperature. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air change the resistance of the sensor. These sensors are typically used indoors and have a short lifespan (perhaps two years). As such they are rarely used in environmental sensing applications, but are included on some common sensors such as the BME680. "],["sensors-in-wildlifesystems.html", "Chapter 6 Sensors in WildlifeSystems 6.1 Devices included in the base system 6.2 Installing sensor support 6.3 Reading data from a device 6.4 The sensor reading process 6.5 Installing new sensors", " Chapter 6 Sensors in WildlifeSystems The WildlifeSystems platform comes with support for some popular existing environmental sensors, although there are many on the market and the range available is subject to constant change. The modular nature of WildlifeSystems allows for new sensors to be easily integrated if the need arises. WildlifeSystems takes an abstracted approach to sensors. Interface modules are provided for each sensor, which can be used to read the sensor data into a standard format. As many physical packages contain multiple sensors (e.g. the supported BME680 can monitor temperature, humidity, air pressure and air quality) there is a conceptual difference between a “device” and the one or more sensors on a device. 6.1 Devices included in the base system The Raspberry Pi does not come with environmental sensors, however there are several onboard sensors that are used to monitor the operation of the hardware, to prevent crucial components from overheating, including the temperature of the CPU and GPU chips. WildlifeSystems provides access to these sensors through the sensor-onboard package, as well as providing some software sensors that report the free memory and free SD storage available. These can be useful for detecting and resolving possible issues on a sensor node before a serious problem arises. 6.2 Installing sensor support Support for sensors is installed as part of the node installation process, however it is possible to install the sensor-control abstraction layer onto any Raspberry Pi system using the command below. sudo apt install sensor-control This will install the sensor-control and sensor-onboard scripts into the system, as well as installing a small of number of supporting packages if they are not already installed. 6.3 Reading data from a device The sensor read command, sr, can be used to list the available devices on a given sensor. sr onboard list The sensor read command, sr, can also be used to read data from a named sensor. Not specifying a sensor is equivalent to reading all sensors on that device (i.e. using the wildcard”*“). sr onboard sr onboard * sr onboard onboard_gpu This will give a JSON string listing information about each sensor (or just the specified sensor), and the current reading. This information can be presented in a more human readable form by piping the output to the program jq, a command line JSON processor. sr onboard | jq 6.4 The sensor reading process The sensor reading process in WildlifeSystems has five steps. The sr command identifies which device script to route the request to. The sensor script calls the sc-prototype script to obtain a template (“prototype”) of the JSON request. The sensor script accesses the relevant sensor(s) and populates the values in a template for each sensor reading, before returning a JSON array of populated readings to sr. The sr script populates additional information for each reading, providing the node_id and a timestamp for each. sr returns the finalised JSON array to the user. 6.5 Installing new sensors New sensors can be installed using the apt package manager once the Wildlife Systems APT repository has been added to the system. Instructions can be found on the webpage Configuring APT for Wildlife Systems.. sudo apt install sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; "],["supported-sensors.html", "Chapter 7 Supported sensors 7.1 List of supported sensors", " Chapter 7 Supported sensors 7.1 List of supported sensors 7.1.1 BME680 4-in-1 sensor that provides humidity, temperature, pressure, and gas readings. 7.1.2 DS18B20 The DS18B20 is a digital thermometer that provides Celsius measurements over a 1-Wire interface. It is a low-cost, low-power device that can be used for a variety of environmental monitoring applications. Waterproof versions are available, making it suitable for use in water and soils. sudo apt install sensor-ds18b20 sudo sr ds18b20 7.1.3 DHT11 The DHT11 is a low-cost temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and sends the data by digital signals on the data pin. The low-cost nature of the sensor makes it useful desp ite several shortcomings, e.g. for monitoring the temperature and humidity inside electronics enclosures where accuracy is not critical but the sensor can provide critical early warning of overheating or condensation. sudo apt install sensor-dht11 sudo sr dht11 7.1.4 LV-MaxSonar-EZ A series of ultrasonic distance sensors that can measure distances from 2 cm to 4 m with high accuracy.

Packages have a standard format, and should be named sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; where &lt;sensor-name&gt; is short, descriptive of the sensor (e.g. model number), and unique within the WildlifeSystems ecosystem. As many people implement various sensors on the Raspberry Pi, it is likely that some sort of solution is already available, that can be tweaked to output readings in the standard format required. However, you must ensure that any licensing conditions are met. In particular, an open license is required if submitting your sensor package to WildlifeSystems for inclusion in the ecosystem. 8.1 Reading the sensor File sensor-&lt;sensor-name&gt; provides the functionality to read the protoype JSON, populate the JSON with sensor readings, and print the output.
