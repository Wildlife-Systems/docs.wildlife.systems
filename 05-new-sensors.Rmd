# Implementing new sensors

## Reading the sensor

File `sensor-<sensor-name>` provides the functionality to read the protoype JSON, populate the JSON with sensor readings, and print the output.

The file can be written in any programming or scripting language, but to prevent overhead consideration should be given to minimising the number of new packages installed.

### In bash

````{bash eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash

# Read the prototype JSON
JSON=$(sc-prototype)

echo -n "["

# Code to read the sensor value into GPU_TEMP

# Use `jq` to modify JSON
SENSOR=$(echo $JSON | jq ".sensor |= \"onboard_gpu\" | .measures |= \"temperature\" | .unit |= \"Celsius\"| .value |= ${GPU_TEMP}")
echo -n $SENSOR

echo "]"
````

### In Python

````{python eval=FALSE}
#!/
import os
import json

# Read the prototype JSON
stream = os.popen('sc-prototype')
output = stream.read()

# Pre-populate with sensor metadata
temperature = json.loads(output)
temperature["sensor"] = "bme680_temperature"
temperature["measures"] = "temperature"
temperature["unit"] = "Celsius"

# Code to read sensor and output in variable `sensor_reading`
temperature["value"] = sensor_reading

# Output the JSON in an array
print("[",json.dumps(temperature),"]")
````

## Setting the environment

The file `<sensor-name>` in the package specifies information that modify the environment of the Raspberry Pi (e.g. if the i2c interface should be enabled) before the `sensor-<sensor-name>` script is run. This allows sensors with different requirements to run sequentially on the same node.

The file must always be present, even if it is empty. During installation the file is moved to `/var/aao/sensors/` and the list of files in this directory indicates to the system which sensors are installed.

TODO: i2c

## Install

The file `install` in the directory is run once, when the sensor package is installed. This allows for the installation of packages and scripts necessary for the functioning of the package.

The file is executed by `bash` and the use of `sudo` is allowed.
