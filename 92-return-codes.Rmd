# Return codes

The various scripts that form the WildlifeSystems ecosystem use a standard set of return codes.

## 00-09 Script functionality

````{r, echo=FALSE}
Code <- seq(from=0, to=1)
Label <- c(
  "OK",
  "Already running"
)
Description <- c(
  "Terminated normally. No error.",
  "The script determined it was already running and terminated."
)
t <- cbind(Code, Label, Description)
knitr::kable(t)
````

## 10-19 Parameter problems

````{r, echo=FALSE}
Code <- seq(from=10, to=11)
Label <- c(
  "Invalid argument",
  "Incorrect filename pattern"
)
Description <- c(
  "One or more of the arguments to the script was invalid.",
  "A standard filename pattern was expected. Allowed values are 'timestamp'."
)
t <- cbind(Code, Label, Description)
knitr::kable(t)
