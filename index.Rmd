# About {-}

This book explains the technologies developed as part of [WildlifeSystems](https://wildlife.systems) and how they can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

## Support {-}

WildlifeSystems nodes were originally developed and used as part of the Leverhulme Trust funded [Automated Acoustic Observatories](https://ebaker.me.uk/aao) project at the University of York. Additional development is undertaken as part of the [Urban Nature Project](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/urban-nature-project.html) at the Natural History Museum, London.
