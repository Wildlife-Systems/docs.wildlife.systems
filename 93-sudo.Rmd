# A note on `sudo`

Raspberry Pi OS (and previously Raspbian) allows the default user to run sudo without a password. This is not true for other Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu. This could lead to a password prompt when using scripts such as `sr` and `ws-indicate`.

When using a standard node configuration this is not an issue as the systemd services that launch these scripts are configured to run as root. However, if you are using these scripts manually you may need to run them with sudo (e.g. `sudo sr onboard`) to get expected behaviour.
