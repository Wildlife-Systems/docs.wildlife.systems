## Documentation

There are three main kinds of documentation in the WildlifeSystems project.

1. __Code comments__: Primarily for future you (or someone similar) to get to grips with your code. _Why does this code do this?_.

2. __Package documentation__: Describes what your package does, how it interacts with the larger system. _What will this package do for me?_

3. __Overall project documentation__: This manual. _How do I use the entire system for my research?_
