# How nodes work

After instllation configuration files are placed in `/etc/ws` that define the operation of the node.

On startup, WildelifeSystems nodes run three systemd services that are responsible for processing audio, images, and environmental sensors. These sensors read the appropriate configuration files, and start collecting and recording data.

## Audio

The service `ws-run-audio` is configured by `/etc/ws/audio.conf` and is responsible for running the audio processing pipeline. The blocks in the pipeline are `record`, `sleep`, `upload-delete`, and `clearup`.

### `init`

### `run`

#### `record`

#### `sleep`

#### `upload-delete`

#### `clearup`

In situations where network connection is temporarily unavailable it is possible that audio files will collect on the advice. These are not automatically processed during `upload-delete` and their processing must be handled manually, or by creating a processing scipt in `clearup`.
